We are excited to announce the expansion of our agricultural operations across East Africa, with new facilities in Tanzania and strategic partnerships in Kenya and Uganda.

## New Grain Storage Facilities

Our state-of-the-art grain storage facilities in Dar es Salaam represent a significant investment in regional food security. With a combined capacity of 50,000 metric tons, these facilities will support local farmers and enable efficient export operations to Middle Eastern and Asian markets.

### Key Features

- Temperature-controlled storage environments
- Advanced pest management systems
- Direct port access for streamlined logistics
- Quality testing laboratories on-site

## Supporting Local Farmers

Beyond infrastructure, we're committed to supporting the agricultural community through:

1. **Training Programs** - Modern farming techniques and post-harvest handling
2. **Fair Pricing** - Transparent pricing mechanisms that benefit farmers
3. **Input Supply** - Access to quality seeds and fertilizers
4. **Market Linkages** - Direct connections to international buyers

## Looking Ahead

This expansion aligns with our vision of creating resilient agricultural supply chains that benefit all stakeholders—from farmers to end consumers. We expect to handle over 200,000 metric tons of grains and oilseeds through these facilities in the coming year.
